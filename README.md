## Applying-data-driven-models-to-human-centric-logistics-systems

Despite the ubiquitous relevance of technologies, the core processes in stationary retail logistics mainly rely on manual work. This includes manual order picking in picker-to-parts order picking systems for warehousing operations (Boysen et al., 2021), manual truck loading, truck driving (Loske & Klumpp, 2020b), route planning in transport operations (Holzapfel et al., 2016), or manual shelf replenishment and online order picking for in-store operations (Reiner et al., 2013). For warehouse operations, recent figures indicate that 80% of all orders are processed in manual picker-to-parts setups (Boysen et al., 2021). Thus, order picking remains labor-intensive, comprising more than 50% of warehouse operating costs (de Koster et al., 2007). The shortage of professional truck drivers is underlining the importance of efficiently deploying the human workforce in transportation. Therefore, the performance evaluation of logistics systems is highly relevant for logistics companies.

At the same time, warehouse management and route planning systems store extensive log data that capture manual operations at a very detailed level. Understanding these datasets, filtering relevant parts, and applying quantitative methods for performance evaluation is essential for creating business value and competitive advantage. However, companies often lack adequate data-driven models and quantitative evaluation approaches.

In this seminar, students will work on real-life datasets from a German grocery retailer to get familiar with structured real-life data. At the end of the seminar, the students should be able to:

- Understand structured real-live data from warehouse management and route planning systems, capturing humansâ€™ work performance at a very detailed level. 
- Filter relevant parts of these datasets for data-driven evaluations and efficiency measurement. 
- Develop data cleaning rules in cooperation with a company expert and apply these rules to the dataset. 
- Apply various quantitative models, e.g., OLS regression, panel regression, multilevel regression (Matusiak et al., 2017), accelerated failure time model (Batt & Gallino, 2019), or Data Envelopment Analysis (Loske & Klumpp, 2020a) to the dataset. 
- Derive, interpret, and prepare results for further presentation. (6) Evaluate and quantify human factors in logistics systems.
